# UniPost Changelog

All notable changes to the UniPost API + MCP server are documented here.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project does not yet follow strict semantic versioning across deploys —
each section heading below corresponds to a sprint, not a published version.

## [Unreleased]

## Sprint 2 (commits `9d89c00..8198902`)

### Added

- **Media library API** (`POST/GET/DELETE /v1/media`). Two-step
  upload: `POST /v1/media` returns a presigned PUT URL the client
  uploads bytes to directly; subsequent publishes reference the
  returned `media_id`. R2-backed (Cloudflare) reusing the bucket
  set up in Sprint 1 for the TikTok PULL_FROM_URL workaround. The
  abandoned-upload sweeper folds into the existing analytics
  refresh worker (no new goroutine) and hard-deletes pending media
  older than 7 days. Per-platform size caps from the capabilities
  table apply on top of a 25 MB global hard ceiling.
- **`platform_posts[].media_ids`** — references rows in the new
  media library. Resolved server-side at adapter dispatch time
  to a fresh 15-minute presigned download URL, then merged with
  the existing `media_urls` list. Adapters see only URLs — zero
  adapter code changes for the new field.
- **Drafts API** — `POST /v1/social-posts` accepts `status="draft"`
  to persist without dispatching. New endpoints:
  - `POST /v1/social-posts/{id}/publish` — atomic draft → publish
    transition with optimistic locking (409 on concurrent publish
    races). Routes through the same publish loop the immediate
    path uses so quota counting / event emission / per-result
    caption persistence stay in one place.
  - `PATCH /v1/social-posts/{id}` — replace draft content. Refuses
    to touch non-draft rows.
  - `DELETE /v1/social-posts/{id}` — already existed; gracefully
    handles drafts (zero results = no platform calls).
- **Hosted preview links** — new `POST /v1/social-posts/{id}/preview-link`
  returns a 24h JWT-signed URL the user can share without exposing
  the API key. The public route `GET /v1/public/drafts/{id}?token=...`
  serves the draft + resolved media URLs to the new dashboard
  preview page at `/preview/[id]` (one column per platform with
  approximate caption count). JWT signed with the existing
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` value plus an `aud:"preview"` claim — no new
  env var.
- **Twitter threads** — `platform_posts[].thread_position` (1-indexed)
  declares a multi-tweet thread. Posts in the same thread group
  dispatch sequentially with the previous tweet's external_id
  threaded through `opts["in_reply_to_tweet_id"]` so the adapter
  can chain via the v2 reply object. Mid-thread failure stops the
  chain and marks remaining tweets as `failed` with an
  `upstream thread post failed at thread_position N` error.
  Standalone posts and other thread groups still run in parallel.
  Twitter only in Sprint 2; Bluesky / Threads land in Sprint 3.
- **`list_posts` filters + cursor pagination** — `GET /v1/social-posts`
  accepts `?status=draft,published&from=...&to=...&limit=...&cursor=...`.
  Cursor is base64url(`unix_nanos|id`) — keyset pagination on the
  new `(project_id, created_at DESC, id DESC)` index. Stable across
  inserts. Response shape changes from the legacy `{ data, meta }`
  envelope to `{ data, next_cursor }`. Clients loop until
  `next_cursor` is empty. `account_id` and `platform` filters from
  the PRD are deferred to Sprint 3 — they need EXISTS subqueries
  against `social_post_results` and a separate index.
- **Account health endpoint** — `GET /v1/social-accounts/{id}/health`
  returns `{status, last_successful_post_at, last_error?, token_expires_at?}`.
  Status derived from the account's last 10 results (no new
  background workers, no active probing): `disconnected` if the
  account row is flagged, `degraded` if any of the 10 failed,
  otherwise `ok`. `last_error` is categorized via substring match
  (`token_expired`, `rate_limited`, `media_too_large`,
  `url_unverified`, `unknown`).
- **MCP server v0.3.0** with five new / two upgraded tools:
  - **NEW** `unipost_upload_media` — accepts EITHER `base64_data`
    (≤4 MB after inflation, for Claude Desktop local files) OR
    `url` (already-hosted files). Wraps the two-step
    `POST /v1/media` + presigned PUT flow.
  - **NEW** `unipost_create_draft` — alias for `create_post` with
    `status="draft"`.
  - **NEW** `unipost_publish_draft` — wraps the new
    publish-from-draft endpoint.
  - **NEW** `unipost_get_account_health` — wraps the new health
    endpoint.
  - `unipost_create_post` and `unipost_validate_post` gain
    `media_ids` and `thread_position` pass-through.
  - `unipost_list_posts` gains the new filter + cursor params.

### Changed

- **Capabilities schema bumped to `1.1`** with one additive field:
  `text.supports_threads`. Twitter is the only `true` value in
  Sprint 2. Old `1.0` consumers ignore the unknown field — the
  bump is purely additive.
- **`internal/mediaproxy` renamed to `internal/storage`**. Same R2
  client, same env vars. Existing TikTok call site updated. The
  package now houses both `UploadFromURL` (TikTok PULL_FROM_URL
  staging, formerly `Upload`) and the new `PresignPut` / `Head` /
  `PresignGet` / `Delete` helpers for the media library.
- **`SocialPostHandler` constructor takes a `*storage.Client`** for
  resolving `media_ids` to presigned download URLs at dispatch time.
- **`scheduler.go` data race fixed** in PR6 — pre-existing append
  from goroutines was already replaced with a fixed-size outcomes
  slice. PR6 (this sprint) also added per-platform routing logs to
  both publish paths for smoke-test correlation.
- **`runPublishLoop`** refactored to dispatch by group (standalone
  posts in parallel, thread groups serial within / parallel across)
  via the new `groupForDispatch` + `runDispatchGroup` helpers.

### Deprecated

- **`media_urls` on the top-level legacy shape** — still works,
  will warn in v0.4. Use `platform_posts[].media_urls` or
  `platform_posts[].media_ids` for new integrations.

### Breaking

- None in Sprint 2.

### Migration notes

- New env vars: none. Sprint 2 reuses `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the
  preview JWT signing key (with an audience claim for domain
  separation) and reuses the `R2_*` env vars set up in Sprint 1.
- New DB migration `019_media_and_list_index.sql` adds the `media`
  table and the `(project_id, created_at DESC, id DESC)` index for
  cursor pagination. Safe to run on existing data — no DDL on
  existing tables.

## Sprint 1 (commits `ade0b7e..f006b28`)

### Added

- **`POST /v1/social-posts` accepts `platform_posts[]`** — a per-account
  request shape with its own `caption`, `media_urls`, `platform_options`,
  and `in_reply_to`. Use it whenever you want to tailor content
  per platform (terse on Twitter, long-form on LinkedIn). The legacy
  `caption + account_ids` shape continues to work and is expanded
  server-side into the same internal representation. (PR5)
- **`idempotency_key` on `POST /v1/social-posts`** — pass the same
  key + project within 24h and the original response is returned
  unchanged (no duplicate platform posts). Replays carry an
  `Idempotent-Replay: true` response header. Backed by a partial
  unique index on `(project_id, idempotency_key)` so the lookup
  index stays small. (PR4 + PR5)
- **`social_post_results.caption` column** — every per-account result
  row now persists the exact caption the platform received, so
  analytics, reads, and the dashboard see the truth instead of the
  parent post's single caption. Existing rows are backfilled from
  `social_posts.caption` during the migration. (PR4 + PR5 + PR6)
- **`GET /v1/platforms/capabilities`** — public, cacheable, no-auth
  endpoint returning the per-platform publish-side capability map
  (caption length, image / video count caps, file size hints,
  threading, scheduling, first-comment support). LLM clients call
  this BEFORE drafting so they can size content correctly without
  burning a publish round-trip. Schema versioned (`schema_version: "1.0"`).
- **`GET /v1/social-accounts/{id}/capabilities`** — same shape but
  scoped to one account. Returns 404 for accounts not in the calling
  project. (PR1)
- **`POST /v1/social-posts/validate`** — pure pre-flight that runs
  the same checks `Create()` runs but writes nothing and calls no
  external APIs. Returns `{ valid, errors[], warnings[] }`. p95 < 1ms
  in benchmarks. (PR2 + PR3)
- **Webhook events fire on publish** — `post.published`, `post.partial`,
  and `post.failed` are now enqueued by both the synchronous publish
  path (`POST /v1/social-posts`) and the scheduler when a scheduled
  post fires. `account.disconnected` fires when an account is
  disconnected via `DELETE /v1/social-accounts/{id}`. Best-effort: a
  failed enqueue NEVER blocks or fails the publish path. (PR7)
- **New webhook management endpoints**: `GET /v1/webhooks/{id}`,
  `PATCH /v1/webhooks/{id}`, `DELETE /v1/webhooks/{id}`,
  `POST /v1/webhooks/{id}/rotate`. (PR8)
- **MCP server v0.2.0** with three new / upgraded tools:
  - `unipost_create_post` now accepts `platform_posts[]` alongside the
    legacy `caption + account_ids` shape. The tool description tells
    Claude / GPT to prefer `platform_posts[]` for multi-platform
    fan-out where the message should differ across networks.
  - `unipost_validate_post` (NEW) — preflight a draft against the
    capability map without publishing.
  - `unipost_get_capabilities` (NEW) — fetch the static
    per-platform capability map.
  (PR9)
- **Per-platform routing log** at INFO level on every adapter
  dispatch in both the immediate (`publish: dispatching to adapter`)
  and scheduled (`scheduler: dispatching to adapter`) flows, showing
  `account_id`, `platform`, and `caption_preview` (first 40 runes +
  ellipsis) so operators can verify per-platform routing in Railway
  logs without instrumenting each adapter individually. (PR6)

### Changed

- **`POST /v1/social-posts/validate` and `POST /v1/social-posts` share
  one validation path** via `platform.ValidatePlatformPosts`. The
  publish path filters to STRUCTURAL errors only (caption length,
  media count, mixing, schedule, threading) so legacy partial-success
  semantics for disconnected/not-in-project accounts are preserved.
- **`Create` validation errors return as a structured `error.issues`
  array** in addition to the existing `error.code = "VALIDATION_ERROR"`.
  Existing error-code switching keeps working; new clients can read
  `error.issues[]` for richer per-field detail.
- **`social_posts.metadata` is now a versioned JSON blob** with
  `schema_version: 2` carrying the full `platform_posts[]` shape.
  Existing rows (v1: `account_ids` + `platform_options`) continue to
  read correctly via the `DecodePostMetadata` v1 fallback path. (PR5 + PR6)
- **Scheduler `publishPost` rewrite** — reads v2 metadata to dispatch
  per-account captions, fixes a pre-existing data race on the `results`
  slice (each goroutine now writes to a fixed-size slot indexed by
  input position), and persists `social_post_results.caption` for every
  result. (PR6)

### Breaking

- **`POST /v1/webhooks` no longer accepts a client-provided `secret`.**
  The signing secret is generated server-side as `whsec_` + 32 hex
  chars and returned in the Create response **exactly once** (and once
  more on `POST /v1/webhooks/{id}/rotate`). Subsequent reads via
  `GET /v1/webhooks` and `GET /v1/webhooks/{id}` return only a
  `secret_preview` (`whsec_xx…`) instead of the plaintext.

  Migration for existing webhooks: existing `webhooks.secret` rows are
  preserved as-is — your existing subscribers continue to verify
  signatures using whatever secret was originally set. To get a
  preview-only response from the API, call `POST /v1/webhooks/{id}/rotate`
  to generate a fresh secret.

  Callers passing `{ "secret": "..." }` to `POST /v1/webhooks` will
  now receive an HTTP 422:

      {
        "error": {
          "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
          "message": "secret is generated server-side; do not provide one ..."
        }
      }

  Update SDKs / scripts to drop the `secret` field and capture the
  one-shot value from the Create response instead.

### Fixed

- **Scheduler data race** on the `results` slice — pre-existing bug
  where multiple goroutines did `results = append(...)` without
  synchronization. Replaced with a fixed-size `outcomes` slice
  indexed by input position. (PR6)
- **Per-platform captions silently dropped on scheduled posts** —
  before this sprint, the scheduler always used the parent post's
  single caption regardless of how the post was created. After PR6
  it reads the per-account caption from the persisted v2 metadata. (PR6)
